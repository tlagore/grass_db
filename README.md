# grass_scraper
Learning go by creating a series of  mini services to scrape a poorly formatted 
flora database into a cleaner format.


## scrape_json
Scrapes 

## parse_json

### Disclaimer
I know it is inefficient to scrape to json and then parse the content instead
of parsing as the content is scraped, but this allows me to experience more aspects 
of go such as file access, json manipulation, etc.
